WebScraping
===========

Webscraping can be informally referred to as reading the website source contents and extracting important contents and manipulating them as per one's use case. Some examples include getting the latest stock market data only within given time intervals and plotting a graph, getting the latest news from popular news sites and upload transfer them to a target webpages.Best use cases is in the field of data science in the context of marketing, all kinds of surveys and reporting.

In this Web Scraping project I will go through separate programs that would perform some form of web scraping but the implications/implementation might be considerably different.
